dlib is a high-level general purpose library for [D language](https://dlang.org) intended to game engine developers. It provides basic building blocks for writing graphics-intensive applications: containers, data streams, linear algebra and image decoders. 

dlib has no external dependencies aside D's standard library. dlib is created and maintained by [Timur Gafarov](https://github.com/gecko0307).

Important message to users and contributors of dlib due to the 2022 Ukraine crisis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**I, Timur Gafarov, creator and maintainer of dlib, live in Russia. dlib has contributors from both Ukraine and Russia, as well as other countries of the world. While working on such projects, there are no borders between people. I strongly believe that politics should not prevent people from sharing knowledge with each other, creating new things and solving intellectual problems.**

**Yet the current political situation can lead to catastrophic consequences, up to the disconnection of all Russian developers from the world community for undefined period, which will seriously affect the projects in which they are actively involved. I hope these fears don't come true, but in case of the worst scenario, I will not be able to participate in the development of the project.**

What's inside
-------------
Currently dlib consists of the following packages:
* [dlib.core](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/core.html) - basic functionality used by other modules (memory management, streams, threads, etc.)
* [dlib.container](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/container.html) - generic data structures (GC-free dynamic and associative arrays and more)
* [dlib.filesystem](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/filesystem.html) - abstract FS interface and its implementations for Windows and POSIX filesystems
* [dlib.math](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/math.html) - linear algebra and numerical analysis (vectors, matrices, quaternions, linear system solvers, interpolation functions, etc.)
* [dlib.geometry](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/geometry.html) - computational geometry (ray casting, primitives, intersection, etc.)
* [dlib.image](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/image.html) - image processing (8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit floating point channels, common filters and convolution kernels, resizing, FFT, HDRI, animation, graphics formats I/O: JPEG, PNG/APNG, BMP, TGA, HDR)
* [dlib.audio](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/audio.html) - sound processing (8 and 16 bits per sample, synthesizers, WAV export and import)
* [dlib.network](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/network.html) - networking and web functionality
* [dlib.memory](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/memory.html) - memory allocators
* [dlib.text](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/text.html) - text processing, GC-free strings, Unicode decoding and encoding
* [dlib.serialization](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/serialization.html) - data serialization (XML and JSON parsers)
* [dlib.coding](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/coding.html) - various data compression and coding algorithms
* [dlib.concurrency](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib/concurrency.html) - a thread pool.

Supported Compilers
-------------------
dlib is automatically tested for compatibility with latest releases of DMD and LDC. Older releases formally are not supported, but in practice usually are, to some extent. There's no guaranteed support for GDC and other D compilers.

Documentation
-------------
There are [ddox documentation](https://gecko0307.github.io/dlib/docs/dlib.html) generated from source code (`dub build --build=ddox`) and [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib/wiki). Be aware that documentation is currently incomplete. I'm running a [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/gecko0307) to reach $100 funding per month - help me get there to finish the documentation.
